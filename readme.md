# WDI-Group-Project

My third project at General Assembly was a group project with two other class members. We were tasked with creating a MEAN stack application for any idea that we had. After some brainstorming we came up with the idea to create an app for road trips called Roadtrippers where you are able to create an account, create a road trip, invite others to the road trip, set a point A to B and add waypoints along the way and also to add pictures from the trip.

## Challenges Faced
From the start of this project we hit quite a few issues with Git and merging. Whenever any of the members of the team made a pull request we were getting merge conflicts in the public files which nobody had touched and because of this it also wasn't registering any changes that we had made, for instance I had to create the front end to the trips show page three times in one day because it wasn't being pushed. So by the third day we were quite far behind schedule.

## What I liked about this project
I really enjoyed working as part of a team in this project, it was my first look in to what it would be like in the real world of development. It was fun coming up with ideas to add into the project and figuring out together if it was possible or not.

## Whats next
Because of the setbacks faced in the first few days of the project there are a couple of things that I want to fix, for instance the add users to a trip function doesn't save the users added and I would like to polish up the styling more.
